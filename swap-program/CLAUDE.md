# ZK Program Example Layout

An example ZK program is a small Solana program that verifies a Groth16 proof
of its rules and CPIs SPP `transact`; it stores no state and owns no accounts.
Each example has a design doc as its source of truth for the privacy model,
instructions, and circuits.

## What Goes Where

- `program`: the Pinocchio program. Instruction processors, proof
  verification, verifying-key constants, instruction data, tags, errors, and
  the canonical public-input hashing. No separate interface crate; the sdk
  re-exports from here.
- `prover`: in-process proving engine on the shared `sdk-libs/gnark-ffi-prover`.
  Go gnark circuits and their registration, proof input struct definitions
  for the prover, circuit constants, and the key-generation binary. Takes
  prepared proof inputs and proves; hashing and domain logic belong in the sdk.
- `sdk`: client library. State definitions, instruction data builders, proof
  input builders, utxo data definitions and hashing, discovery, encryption
  codecs, and the prover client. Owns all transformation between domain types
  and proof inputs. Per-circuit prove/verify tests live here.
- `test`: localnet end-to-end tests and CU benchmarks.

## Patterns

- program: one file per instruction under `src/instructions/`; each verifies
  its proof against the public-input hash, then CPIs SPP `transact` with the
  program authority PDA flipped to a signer. Public-input hash impls live next
  to the instruction and are reused by the sdk. Host-side unit tests
  (error-code stability, boundary checks) in `tests/`.
- prover: `circuits/main.go` registers each circuit by name with the
  `zolana/gnarkffiprover` bridge, which `circuits/go.mod` requires without a
  `replace`; `build.rs` calls
  `zolana_gnark_ffi_prover_build::build_prover_archive()`, which supplies the
  bridge and compiles the package to a c-archive; `lib.rs` names the circuits
  in a `zolana_gnark_ffi_prover::Circuit` enum and declares
  `pub static PROVER = zolana_gnark_ffi_prover::prover!(<key root>)`, whose
  `setup` / `preload` / `prove` the rest of the crate and the tests call.
  Proof input structs are pure containers whose only logic is witness-map
  encoding and a `prove()` method. Circuits take UTXOs as `gnarksdk.Utxo` and
  build their hashes, the private tx hash and the blinding checks from
  `zolana/gnarksdk` (`sdk-libs/gnark-sdk`); `circuits/go.mod` replaces it and
  `zolana/prover` with their directories. Go tooling in `circuits/` needs the
  bridge replace too: `just example-circuits-go vet ./...`.
- sdk: one directory per instruction with `instruction.rs` (builder struct
  with a consuming `instruction()` method, not free functions) and
  `proof.rs` (a params struct with `to_proof_inputs()` doing validation and
  hashing); `mod.rs` only re-exports. Shared helpers in `shared.rs`. The
  prover client mirrors `zolana_client::ProverClient`: one `prove_*` method
  per circuit, no data processing.
- test: Rust end-to-end flows against localnet + photon + prover; mollusk
  CU profiling that regenerates the benchmark doc.

## Dependencies

- program: `pinocchio` (+`cpi`), `zolana-interface`, `zolana-account-checks`,
  `zolana-hasher` (+`poseidon`), `groth16-solana` (+`bsb22`) for verification,
  `wincode`/`borsh` for instruction data, `thiserror` +
  `solana-program-error` for errors. Never sdk crates.
- prover: `zolana-gnark-ffi-prover` for the FFI, key loading, proof compression and
  UTXO witness encoding (`zolana-gnark-ffi-prover-build` as the build dependency),
  `zolana-client` for proof input UTXOs, the program crate for shared types.
- sdk: `zolana-client`, `zolana-keypair`, `zolana-transaction`,
  `solana-instruction`/`solana-address` for wire types, plus the program and
  prover crates.
- test: `zolana-program-test` + `zolana-test-utils` for the harness,
  `zolana-client` (+`indexer-api`, `solana-rpc`), `mollusk-svm` +
  `light-program-profiler` for benchmarks.

## Key Artifacts

- `build/gnark/<circuit>/{pk,vk}.bin`: generated proving/verifying keys,
  pinned by checksum. They are insecure deterministic test keys, UNSAFE for
  production: `just ensure-swap-keys` generates them locally, and
  `just regen-swap-keys` rewrites the committed verifying keys and checksums.
- `program/src/verifying_keys/`: committed Rust vk constants; must match the
  generated keys.
